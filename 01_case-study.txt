Case Study
Managing a Challenging Cross-Department Collaboration

As a software manager, I oversee a development team that handles various projects. Recently, another department approached me with a request for a joint effort. They were seeking help from our software engineers to support their team in the Research and Development (R&D) department, as they were facing tight deadlines. The challenge was clear: the R&D department needed assistance to meet their target dates, and we had to step in and assist, despite the fact that there was a significant learning curve involved.

Although the schedule was already very tight, we decided to lend our support to help them meet their goals. Despite the initial challenges, the collaboration showed promising progress. However, as we were nearing the end of the project and approaching the target deadline, one of my developers faced a personal family crisis, which unfortunately disrupted our progress and further jeopardised our ability to meet the deadline.

Questions for Consideration:

As a Manager: How would you handle the situation when a key team member faces a personal issue that affects the project timeline? What steps would you take to ensure the team stays on track, and how would you communicate with both the client and your team?
As a Developer: If you were the one facing a family emergency, how would you handle the situation to ensure that it doesn't negatively impact the project timeline? What actions would you take to manage your workload, communicate effectively with your manager, and ensure the project stays on course?
What Could Have Been Done Better?: Reflect on how both the manager and the developer could have better anticipated potential risks and mitigated issues before they arose. What strategies might have helped avoid this situation or managed it more effectively?


ANSWER:
1. As a Manager: Managing the Personal Crisis of a Team Member
When there is a personal matter that impacts the contribution of that employee to a schedule, the manager will:
    Listen and Show Empathy: It is now the time to be empathetic. Provide an ear to the employee by not interrupting him/her and certainly not giving unsolicited advice. That may demonstrate to him/her that he/she cares for his or her condition and trusts him or her.
    Share workload and roles: Review the workload of the affected team member. Share some components of the work from the affected person to other colleagues in the team to share the load build-up on that person. Timeframes can be temporarily altered or the urgent tasks can be shared out to ensure a project is kept moving.
    Open Communication: Let both your team and the client be in the know about changes in responsibilities due to a personal crisis without exposing sensitive information about the employee's situation. Such management is very effective in the adjustment of expectations and also shows a culture that is supportive of the team.
    Develop Contingency Plans: Be prepared with secondary plans to deal with potential worst-case scenarios, such as naming other team members who could be called on in case, or looking into temporary hires if the situation may run longer.
    Check In Regularly: Monitor the employee to monitor well-being and increase support when needed. This keeps open communication lines, indicating you care about their well-being and contributions to the team.

2. As a Developer: Mitigating Your Task Impact during Crisis
When there is an emergency at home, to minimize impact on the project, one should:
    Communicate Early: Communicate with your manager as soon as possible. Transparency allows for better planning and support from your team.
    Prioritize Tasks: Work on critical tasks that may require your attention sooner rather than later and let your manager know which parts of your task may wait or be temporarily handed off.
    Utilize available resources: If your organization provides assistance through counseling or adjustment in work arrangement, then use this resource to handle your personal crisis so you can continue to be productive.
    Boundary setting: Just as important as staying committed to work, it's the ability of making boundaries to give time to address a personal crisis without overwhelmed by being threatened with responsibility.

3. What Could Have Been Done Differently?
From this perspective, one would see several strategies of proactive risk management about how both parties could foresee likely risks on the line. There should be regular communication between managers and employees about any personal potential problems that could impact work life by making the employees feel free to discuss their problems before they become problems that are long-standing.
Support Systems. The organization should have clear policies in relation to support at personal crisis times, including flexible arrangements at work and also mental health resources. The organization should inform all its employees about available assistance.
Promoting Team Resilience. The culture of resilience in teams prepares its members for unexpected challenges and provides teamwork and mutual support during difficult times.
Having adopted these measures, then the managers and developers will be in a better position to deal with personal crises so that the project timeline remains intact alongside the well-being of an individual.
